# SerialLightControl-Server.py - This is the code to complete
# Milestone Two.
#
# This Python code will be used to control the light in the circuit
# that you built on your solderless breadboard in Milestone One based
# on the instructions read from the serial port of your Raspberry pi.
#
# This script requires that you have correctly configured your Serial
# port and have a USB -> TTL cable connected appropriately.

# This imports the Python serial package to handle communications over the
# Raspberry Pi's serial port.
import serial

# Load the GPIO interface from the Raspberry Pi Python Module
# The GPIO interface will be available through the GPIO object
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Because we imported the entire package instead of just importing Serial and
# some of the other flags from the serial package, we need to reference those
# objects with dot notation.
#
# e.g. ser = serial.Serial
#
ser = serial.Serial(
        port='/dev/ttyS0', # This would be /dev/ttyAM0 prior to Raspberry Pi 3
        baudrate = 115200, # This sets the speed of the serial interface in
                           # bits/second
        parity=serial.PARITY_NONE,      # Disable parity
        stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE,   # Serial protocol will use one stop bit
        bytesize=serial.EIGHTBITS,      # We are using 8-bit bytes
        timeout=1          # Configure a 1-second timeout
)

# Setup the GPIO interface
#
# 1. Turn off warnings for now - they can be useful for debugging more
#    complex code.
# 2. Tell the GPIO library we are using Broadcom pin-numbering. The
#    Raspberry Pi CPU is manufactured by Broadcom, and they have a
#    specific numbering scheme for the GPIO pins. It does not match
#    the layout on the header. However, the Broadcom pin numbering is
#    what is printed on the GPIO Breakout Board, so this should match!
# 3. Tell the GPIO library that we are using GPIO line 18, and that
#    we are using it for Output. When this state is configured, setting
#    the GPIO line to true will provide positive voltage on that pin.
#    Based on the circuit we have built, positive voltage on the GPIO
#    pin will flow through the LED, through the resistor to the ground
#    pin and the LED will light up.
GPIO.setwarnings(False)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)

# Configure our loop variable
repeat = True

# Loop until the user hits CTRL-C or the client sends an exit/quit message
while repeat:

        # Read lines from the serial port 1 at a time.
        # This will block until we have data available.
        try:
                # Read a line from the serial port.
                # This also decodes the result into a utf-8 String (utf-8 is the
                # default North American English character set) and
                # normalizes the input to lower case.
                command = ((ser.readline()).decode("utf-8")).lower().strip()

                # This is a state-machine implementation in Python.
                # We match on the value of a variable with individual
                # cases used to represent each state. We can also build stateful
                # objects in python which we will study as we progress in
                # this course.
                #
                # Please note, you can indicate multiple keys that represent the
                # same state by using a pipe symbol to represent a boolean 'or'.
                #
